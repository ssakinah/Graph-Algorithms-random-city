# Graph-Algorithms-random-city
This was an assignment group project of 3 people for Design & Analysis of Algorithms course. Each member were assigned to do 1 function as below: </br></br>
a. Function 1: Check if the graph is strongly connected. If it is not, generate random edges* between random cities until the graph is strongly connected. Print the resulting graph.</br>
b. Function 2: Check if the graph has a cycle. If it is not, generate random edges* between random cities until the graph has a cycle. Print the resulting cycle.</br>
c. Function 3: Allow the user to select two vertices and compute the shortest path between the vertices. If there is no path between the selected vertices, generate random edges* between random cities until the path exists. Print the shortest path.</br>
### Objectives</br>
The purpose of this assignment is to test your understanding of graph representation and algorithms. You will be required to code the actual algorithms to solve problems that have been discussed in class.
